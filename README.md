# Doug Lazarini

## About Me
I grew up in the countryside of São Paulo state, in a valley near the mountains and the ocean, a rich place with nature and culture like art, music, and people's simple traditions. Living there turns me passionate about art and people, mixing that with my love for technology, which results in what I’m today. Since 2009 I had been working with visual and interaction design on agencies and digital products.

In the last few years, I have been working with educational and entrepreneurship products, that I had the incredible experience and challenge to impact thousands of people in Brazil, working hard to deliver a great user experience.
