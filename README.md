# Doug Lazarini

## About Me
Hello, I'm Doug, based in Campinas, Brazil, near São Paulo. Since embarking on my web design journey in 2010, I've transitioned into a Product Designer role, honing my skills in design systems.

I've had the privilege of working with product design and design systems in some of Brazil's leading startups, including Quero Bolsa, an educational marketplace empowering individuals to pursue college and university education; MLabs, a platform designed to streamline social media operations for small businesses and agencies; and Meiuca, a consulting firm recognized as one of the best in Design System, aiding tech giants in the field.

Currently, I'm part of the design system team at BEES and AB-Inbev. The team is responsible for building, maintaining, and evolving the Hexa design system; it also ensures consistency and coherence in the design across different products and platforms by setting design principles and standards. We create and update components and patterns, document usage guidelines, and work closely with other designers and developers to implement the design system effectively. Ultimately, we educate other team members about the system, gather feedback, and make necessary improvements to adapt to the changing needs of the users and the organization.

It’s an exciting challenge, and I’m happy to be part of the team.
